    <p>John Abbott Collegeâ€™s Student Employment Centre offers you the option of submitting your job offers 
        on this site free of charge. Once your offer is approved, students and graduates will be able to view 
        it and apply online. Information on each candidate applying for your job posting will be sent directly
         to the email address you will have specified.<br><br>

        Please note that your contact information (mailing address, email address and telephone) will NOT
         be visible to the students. During school days, part-time jobs must not exceed 20 hours per week to
          be accepted. We do not post a job that pays commission only. Telemarketing jobs will require 
          additional information to be approved.<br><br>
        
        Employment offers that you send us will be reviewed and approved by the Student Employment Centre
         usually within two working days. It is important to provide all of the requested information so that
          we may contact you should we have questions.
